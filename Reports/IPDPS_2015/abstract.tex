Different processors across the nodes have different execution times for the
same work-loads. This performance imbalance is more prominent  when the CPU power is
capped to low values. This performance imbalance causes increased execution
times of the parallel applications.  We propose a load balancer using Charm++
parallel programming framework which minimizes the performance imbalance at the
lower power caps by tackling this heterogeneity.
