Different processors across the nodes have different execution times for the
same work-loads. This performance imbalance is seen only when the CPU power is
capped to low values. This performance imbalance causes increased execution
times of the parallel applications.  We propose a power aware load balancer which
minimizes the performance imbalance at the lower power caps by tackling this
heterogeneity.
