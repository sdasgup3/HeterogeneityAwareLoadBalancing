The idea  is drawn from the future guidelines of the work by Osman et
al.\cite{powerCluster2013} and \cite{osmanthesis}.  It has been empirically
observed that under the same power cap, different nodes yield different
application performance. This can be due to several design factors: difference
in chip designs, different in component assembly by the machine vendor,
   location of the node in the data center, difference in component design such
   as fans, etc. This difference in the design causes load imbalance across
   nodes despite same allocated power and equal compute load. Moreover we are
   going to experimentally show that this heterogeneity in nodes is more
   prominent at lower power caps.  Our goal is to minimize the load imbalance
   in the presence of such heterogeneity in nodes using the over-decomposition
   and dynamic object migration features of Charm++\cite{ChareKernelICPP90}. 

The rest of the presentation is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:approach}
depicts the detailed approach of our work. Section~\ref{sec:expr} gives the
experimental setup used and the results obtained. Finally the
Section~\ref{sec:fw} points out the conclusion and the future work.
