Abstract:
Different processors across the nodes have different execution times for the same workloads. This performance imbalance is seen only when the CPU power is capped to low power values. This performance imbalance causes increased execution times of the parallel applications. We propose a power aware load balancer (Using Charm++) which minimizes the performance imbalance at the lower power caps by tackling this heterogeneity.
